# Welcome!

We are the Statistics Graduate Student Association at UW-Madison. We founded in 2018 with the goal of coordinating the graduate student activities of the department. We currently coordinate the student seminar, the department happy hour at The Sett, and this website. We also hope to create a stronger community among the statistics department by focusing on development of our professional networks, training in modern statistical tools, and cultivation of research interests.

Here we've collected a number of resources we hope will be helpful for both current and new students here at UW-Madison, including information on coursework, career resources, and things to do around Madison.

## Fall 2018 Events

### Department Happy Hour

The student seminars are a chance for students to come together, practice their research talks, present interesting topics, and share their student experiences. The regularity of the talks depends on the number of speakers and general attendance. We normally send out a survey and set most of the schedule at the beginning of the semester. Check out the student seminar page for the most up-to-date information for the student seminars!

### Mid-Autumn Festival Picnic

Every Fall, we celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival (or Harvest Moon Festival)
with a large picnic and barbecue at a local park. It has been tradition for a
group of third year students to help organize the celebration for the entire
department. The characteristic tradition during this festival is making and
eating mooncakes, whose roundness signifies completeness and reunion.  Although
the festival originates in Chinese culture, the celebration is all-inclusive;
we encourage everyone to attend!
