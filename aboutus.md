# Welcome!

We are the Statistics Graduate Student Association at UW-Madison. We founded in 2018 with the goal of coordinating the graduate student activities
of the department. We currently coordinate the student seminar, the department happy hour at The Sett, and this website. We also hope to create a stronger community among the
statistics department by focusing on development of our professional networks,
training in modern statistical tools, and cultivation of research interests.

Here we've collected a number of resources we hope will be helpful for both current and new students here at UW-Madison, including information on coursework, career resources, and things to do around Madison. Below is a short summary of our activities.


### Student Seminar

The student seminars are a chance for students to come together, practice their research talks, present interesting topics, and share their student experiences. The regularity of the talks depends on the number of speakers and general attendance. We normally send out a survey and set most of the schedule at the beginning of the semester. Check out the student seminar page for the most up-to-date information for the student seminars!

### Department Happy Hour

<em style="color: var(--theme-color,#42b983)">Join us for our first happy hour of Fall 2018, Thursday, Aug 30th at 4 pm at The Sett in Union South!!</em>

In the same vein of the social traditions started by our department founder
George Box, we gather at The Sett in Union South fairly regularly to talk about
statistics and have fun. Check your emails for a reminder during the week of
the social. The schedule for this Fall 2018 semester is TBD. This is a great
chance to hang out and talk with other people in our department that you don't
get to see very often!  Everyone is welcome at the Department Happy Hour -
faculty, staff, students, families, and friends. The more the merrier!

### UW-Madison Student's T

The "T" is for talk! This is an opportunity for us graduate students to decide who comes to our department seminar! We invite one speaker per year to give a talk in the department. All graduate students in our department are invited to discuss and vote on who we should invite. The current voting and discussion is administered through [this Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/uw-madison-students-t).

### Mid-Autumn Festival Picnic

Every Fall, we celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival (or Harvest Moon Festival)
with a large picnic and barbecue at a local park. It has been tradition for a
group of third year students to help organize the celebration for the entire
department. The characteristic tradition during this festival is making and
eating mooncakes, whose roundness signifies completeness and reunion.  Although
the festival originates in Chinese culture, the celebration is all-inclusive;
we encourage everyone to attend!
