## General Involvement

We are actively recruiting for any students that would like to help organize events for the organization! We're excited that you want to get involved, and would love to talk with you! Whether you simply want your opinion heard during our open discussions, or create a new event in the department, we welcome your involvement.

## Officer Elections

We elect officers at the beginning of the Fall semester on a yearly cycle. If you are interested in an officer position, please contact one of the current officers for more information, and read the organization bylaws for a description of the general responsibilities associated with the position.

## Issues and Pull Requests

The website is also publically hosted on Github, so you may create a pull request or submit an issue ticket if you have any changes to the website you'd like to add or see.

Please contact Michael Liou at myliou [at] wisc.edu if you are interested in helping or have any questions!
